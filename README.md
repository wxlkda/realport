## KaTeX

  

You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/):

  

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

  

$$

\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.

$$

## UML diagrams

  

You can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:
